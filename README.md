## Seymour- A shop for customizable user defined Pizzas

This is a project i developed for my **Object Oriented Programming(OOP)** course in the university.
Project collaborators include Myself, Fawad Jawed Fateh and ArunJai. 

Seymour was developed with customizablity in mind. There are 2 main sides of the project:
##### - The Management Side
##### - The Ordering Side

1. The Management side includes portals for the Restaurant Manager, The Chefs and the Delivery Boys. Each of whom have different tasks like one would observe in the real world.

2. The ordering side itself has 2 different starting options:
  * Order as Guest.
  * Order as a Registered Customer.

A large amount of derived classes were used to provide different types of toppings, flavours and crusts for the Pizza. 

The UI is completely graphical with no console output. This was achieved with the help of Windows Forms for C++/CLR. All classes were used as unmanaged to allow the usage of pointers and references in the project. 

#### How to Compile and Run:
1. Create an Empty C++ Project on Visual Studio (2019 preferred)
2. Add a windows forms file in sources files by right clicking on source files > Add new > UI  > Windows form
3. Import the header files into the project and similarly the Class definitions.
4. The class diagrams are optional and are used to help in understanding the structure of the program.
5. Once imported, you'll have to make some changes based on your Program's specifications including your project name and/or your directory structure. 
6. Myform.h has all the visuals and the design of the project. Any changes you make must also be made in MyForms.cpp
7. Compile and run using Ctrl+F5 or debug using F5.
